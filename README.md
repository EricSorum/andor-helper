# Andor Helper

This Chrome extension serves as an important reminder to users that rather than watch inferior shows, they could be watching "Andor," the Emmy-nominated, dramatic spy-thriller from acclaimed writer Tony Gilroy.

The reminder will appear over listengs on popular streaming services, including Hulu, Netflix, Apple TV, Amazon Video, as well as all other shows on Disney+.

My hope is that this extension will save many wasted hours, and encourage fans in advocating for the one truly superior addition to the Star Wars franchise.
